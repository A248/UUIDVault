 * UUIDVault's main API class. <br>
 * Dependents wishing to utilise UUIDVault should use this class to

 * <br>
 * <b>Usage</b> <br>
 * Most usage will begin with getting the instance via <code>UUIDVault.get()</code>. <br>
 * When finding UUIDs or names, the caller does NOT need to check against the current
 * active playerlist or builtin server caches. UUIDVault will check these automatically.
