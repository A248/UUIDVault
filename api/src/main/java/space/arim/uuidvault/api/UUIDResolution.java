/**
 * A service which maps names to UUIDs and vice versa. <br>
 * Uses names, not display names. Names should ignore case. <br>
 * <br>
 * The general contract regarding UUID/name resolution is that a name may map to several
 * uuids, but a uuid may only map to a single name. This means the behaviour of this name
 * mapping is explicitly nondeterministic: calling name resolution methods ({@link #resolve(String)}
 * and {@link #resolveImmediately(String)}) may produce different results in the span of a short time.
 * (This may happen if the implementation has some weird algorithm for resolution). Or, more likely,
 * a new player may join with the given name after the first call, such that the second call returns
 * the new player's uuid instead. <br>
 * <br>
 * On the contrary, calling uuid resolution methods ({@link #resolve(UUID)} and {@link #resolveImmediately(UUID)})
 * should produce the same name provided no name change has been detected. It is still possible that the player
 * has in fact changed his or her name, but this information is not yet available to the implementation. <br>
 * <br>
 * Implementations are not in any way required to update old mappings via calls to the Mojang API
 * (or Mojang API proxies thereof, e.g. https://github.com/Electroid/mojang-api). Thus, some
 * implementations may continue to store months old mappings. This is a feature, not a bug;
 * it enables plugins to have a wide breadth of information from which to draw on. For example,
 * in punishment plugins, a Moderator might find evidence of a rule breaker a month after the event,
 * and desire to punish such player by their name. Ideally, the name of the player maps to the correct UUID.
