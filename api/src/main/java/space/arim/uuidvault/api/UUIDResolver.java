/**
 * A service which maps names to UUIDs and vice versa. <br>
 * Uses names, not display names. <i>Names should ignore case</i>. <br>
 * <br>
 * The general contract regarding UUID/name resolution is that a name may map to several
 * uuids, but a uuid may only map to a single name. This means the behaviour of this name
 * mapping is explicitly nondeterministic: calling name resolution methods ({@link #resolve(String)}
 * and {@link #resolveImmediately(String)}) may produce different results over the span of time. Most likely,
 * this may happen if a new player joins with the given name after the first call, such that the second call
 * returns the new player's uuid instead. <br>
 * <br>
 * On the contrary, calling uuid resolution methods ({@link #resolve(UUID)} and {@link #resolveImmediately(UUID)})
 * should produce the same name provided no name change has been detected. It is still possible that the player
 * has in fact changed his or her name, but this information is not yet available to the implementation. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Implementations SHOULD NEVER call the Mojang API</b> as part of their implementation of the 'resolve' methods.
 * If every resolver called the Mojang API, the server would quickly incur rate limiting. This also applies
 * to Mojang API proxies thereof, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Electroid/mojang-api">Electroid's API</a>.
 * If the plugin stores the UUID/name mappings itself, whether stored in a memory, a database, or a flatfile,
 * <i>then</i> it should have a corresponding implementation of this interface. A good rule of thumb is that
 * if the plugin is the sole accessor of this data store, or the main accessor if it exposes an API,
 * then it should implement this interface. <br>
 * <br>
 * Implementations are not in any way required to update or expire old mappings. Thus, some
 * implementations may continue to store months old mappings. This is a feature, not a bug;
 * it enables plugins to have a wide breadth of information from which to draw on. For example,
 * in punishment plugins, a moderator might find evidence of a rule breaker a month after the event,
 * and desire to punish such player by their name. Ideally, the name of the player maps to a UUID. <br>
