# If enabled, UUIDVault will inform a hooked plugin of a uuid/name mapping if it
# couldn't find the mapping but another plugin did. Plugins can choose to ignore this.
# 
# Can help reduce reliance on specific plugins by spreading the information around,
# but will increase the size of uuid/name databases consequently.
