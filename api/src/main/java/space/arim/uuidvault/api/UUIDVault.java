/**
 * UUIDVault's main API class. <br>
 * Dependents wishing to utilise UUIDVault should use this class to
 * lookup uuid/name mappings. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Usage</b> <br>
 * Most usage will begin with getting the instance via <code>UUIDVault.get()</code>. <br>
 * All methods are thread safe unless specified otherwise. <br>
 * All name lookups are case insensitive. <br>
 * <br>
 * One should generally begin by checking native server information, namely online players and the offline player cache,
 * for players matching the UUID or name. This may be done at the caller's discretion - either automatically using
 * {@link #resolveNatively(String)} and {@link #resolveNatively(UUID)}, or manually, using environment-specific APIs. <br>
 * <br>
 * Then, one may proceed to check the registered resolvers. If the caller needs an immediate result,
 * {@link #resolveImmediately(String)} and {@link #resolveImmediately(UUID)} may be used. Otherwise, if the caller wants a full
 * result using all information from resolvers, {@link #resolve(String)} and {@link #resolve(UUID)}, will return
 * <code>CompletableFuture</code>s.
