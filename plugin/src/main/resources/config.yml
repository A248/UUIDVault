# UUIDVault configuration
# Plugin version: ${core.version}
#

# If enabled, UUIDVault will inform a hooked plugin of a uuid/name mapping if it
# couldn't find the mapping but another plugin did. Plugins can choose to ignore this.
# 
# Can help reduce reliance on specific plugins by spreading the information around,
# but will increase the size of uuid/name databases consequently.
# Careful: if 1 plugin goes "rogue" or isn't working, this option may pollute the others
# It is therefore recommended to only enable this option on fully-configured servers
mutual-updating: false

# don't ever touch this
